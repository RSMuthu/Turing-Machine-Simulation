Turing Machine Simulation
==========================================

The Commands used for the Turing Machine Simulation are available in the 'cmd_list.txt' file.

PreRequesite For using Executable file
-----------------------------------------
OS: Windows


There are two ways in which we can run the Simulation

_______________________________
#1 - Execute '.tur' file
_______________________________

---> Start command prompt.
---> Navigate to this current directory of 'ReadMe.txt' file
---> Execute the command ".\Simulation\dist\turing_simulation\turing_simulation.exe <file_name>.tur"
---> Example: to execute sample code from this current directory ".\Simulation\dist\turing_simulation\turing_simulation.exe .\examples\sample0.tur"

_______________________________
#2 - Execute as a Console
_______________________________

---> Assuming that you are in current directory of 'ReadMe.txt' file_name
---> Run the file 'turing_simulation.exe' in the folder ".\Simulation\dist\turing_simulation\" (relative path is ".\Simulation\dist\turing_simulation\turing_simulation.exe")
---> Turing Machine Simulation Console appears.
---> Now you can Run the Turing Machine Commands, just as we run Python commands in the Python Console.



PreRequesite For Working with Source code
-----------------------------------------
OS: any
Python 2.7

_______________________________
#1 - Executing from Source code
_______________________________

---> Clone the 'Source' folder from the project folder.
---> Open the command prompt and navigate to that cloned folder.
---> Run the command "python main.py" (for Turing machine Console) or "python main.py <file_name>.tur" (for running a '.tur' file)
