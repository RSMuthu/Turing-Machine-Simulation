Turing Machine Simulation
==========================================

The Commands used for the Turing Machine Simulation are available in the 'cmd_list.md' file.

### PreRequesite For using Executable file
OS: Windows
<br>

There are two ways in which we can run the Simulation

#### 1. - Execute '.tur' file
_______________________________

---> Start command prompt.<br>
---> Navigate to this current directory of 'ReadMe.txt' file<br>
---> Execute the command ".\Simulation\dist\turing_simulation\turing_simulation.exe <file_name>.tur"<bR>
---> Example: to execute sample code from this current directory ".\Simulation\dist\turing_simulation\turing_simulation.exe .\examples\sample0.tur"

#### 2. - Execute as a Console
_______________________________

---> Assuming that you are in current directory of 'ReadMe.txt' file_name<br>
---> Run the file 'turing_simulation.exe' in the folder ".\Simulation\dist\turing_simulation\" (relative path is ".\Simulation\dist\turing_simulation\turing_simulation.exe")<br>
---> Turing Machine Simulation Console appears.<br>
---> Now you can Run the Turing Machine Commands, just as we run Python commands in the Python Console.


### PreRequesite For Working with Source code
OS: any <br>
Python 2.7

#### 1 - Executing from Source code
_______________________________

---> Clone the 'Source' folder from the project folder.<br>
---> Open the command prompt and navigate to that cloned folder.<br>
---> Run the command "python main.py" (for Turing machine Console) or "python main.py <file_name>.tur" (for running a '.tur' file)
